I am a Ph.D. student in the Electrical Engineering & Computer Science Department at South Dakota State University. I hold a Master of Science degree in Artificial Intelligence from Iowa State University, as well as a Master's degree in Computer Science from South Dakota State University. Additionally, I earned my Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from Kookmin University in South Korea.

<!-- As a Ph.D. student, I am actively involved in teaching and mentorship. I have had the privilege of assisting with [mention any courses or programs you have been involved in]. I find joy in sharing knowledge and helping others grow in their understanding of computer science. -->

My research interests lie in **Applied machine learning (Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing)**. 

**Under construction.**
