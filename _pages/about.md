I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science department at Iowa State University. I received MS degree in Computer Science department at South Dakota State University. Prior to that, I completed my Bachelor of Science in the department of Electrical Engineering at Kookmin University in South Korea. 

<!-- As a Ph.D. student, I am actively involved in teaching and mentorship. I have had the privilege of assisting with [mention any courses or programs you have been involved in]. I find joy in sharing knowledge and helping others grow in their understanding of computer science. -->

My research interests lie in **Applied machine learning (Image processing and Natural Language Processing)**. 

**Under construction.**
